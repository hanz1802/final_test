        <h2>An Automatic Gain Control (AGC) Amplifier for Ultra Wideband Applications, UMich</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Designed an AGC system consisting of Variable Gain Amplifier (VGA), Peak Detector, Error Amplifier, Loop Filter and Bandgap Voltage Reference using Cadence Virtuoso in CMOS IBM 130nm process with 2.84mW power consumption</li>
            <li>Achieved the VGA performance with 26.5dB gain range and 460MHZ bandwidth, the 2-stage operational amplifier with 53dB gain, 102.52MHz GBW and 60.325Â° phase margin under miller compensation</li>
            <li>Analyzed and calculated transistor sizing by specification and opeartion mode, compressed the AGC system overall gain to be stable with the closed-loop feedback to the control voltage of VGA</li>
